        India is one of the world’s fastest growing economies. With a consistent GDP growth rate of around 7%, it is gradually moving towards being one of the biggest economies. Couple that with the Make in India campaign, a lot of employment opportunities are about to come up. This will see a good number of people moving from towns and villages to cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata(to name a few) where they may move to pursue their dreams.<br />
        Moving to these three economic powerhouses of our country comes with a big struggle of finding an accommodation !<br />
        Finding a place to stay in three of the biggest and most populous metropolitan cities of India, can never be easy.<br /><br />

        A few years ago, we grabbed our opportunity that came across our way and some of us moved to the cultural capital of the south, Chennai, some to the power house in the east & some to the financial capital of our country, Mumbai. We packed our bags and let out to the unknown, to the world where we could see all our dreams come true.<br />
        What's the first thing you'd do if you moved to a new city?<br />
        Search for an accommodation.<br /><br />

        We did the same. We browsed the internet, asked a few locals for good paying guests in Chennai and visited every place only to be mostly left disappointed because of the place already been booked or not matching our priorities.<br />
        Eventually, we managed to find ourselves a paying guest in Chennai, close to our workplace but we had to face a lot of difficulties.The same routine for the other cities.<br /><br />

        That's when we came up with the concept of Lock your Stay!<br /><br />

        Wouldn't it be great if you can just Browse -> Select -> Book yourself an accommodation or live as a paying guest in Chennai? In other words, simply Lock Your Stay by logging into lockyourstay.com<br /><br />

        When we first came to this city, we had no other option than booking a hotel and going from one place to another from there.<br />
        i.e. Book a temporary stay until you find yourself a more concrete accommodation.<br />
        But now, YOU have the ease of just booking your pg with the help of a single click!<br />
        Moreover it eliminates the need of a broker! No need to spend extra bucks on a middle-man. At Lock Your Stay, our certified agent takes care of all that at a minimal charge.<br /><br />

        So what are you waiting for?<br />
        Spread the word and make life easier for your friends and/or family who are moving to the city and help them book a paying guest in Chennai, Mumbai or Kolkata hassle-free!<br /><br />
